# HOW TO USE IT
It's really easy to install and let it run, download the polyredeemer.js script and place it in the SAME folder where you keep your .env file
Be sure to put your PK=0x... and PBK=0x.. (your private and public key) IN your .env file
Make a script on your server to let it run 24/7, it will check for positions every 15 minutes, if you don't have a server you could also run it manually whenever you want
